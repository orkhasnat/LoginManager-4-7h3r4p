# Simple Login Manager for Therap Sites
- Choose which profile you want to log in as.
- Select login once to go to password form.
- Select login again to log in.
- Manage (Add, Update, Delete) your profiles.


### TODO
- ~~remove hardcoded data~~
- update ui
- ~~Edit the profiles~~
- Change Profile Order by Dragging
- work perfectly for incognito (might need to store in `chrome.storage.local` as well)
- **Make it compatible with Firefox as well**
- *Maybe add automatic update? (like Password Manager)*
