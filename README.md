### TODO
- ~~remove hardcoded data~~
- ~~update ui~~
- ~~Edit the profiles~~
- Change Profile Order by Dragging
- work perfectly for incognito (might need to store in `chrome.storage.local` as well)
- ~~Have an export profiles button that can export all the creds, and also an import profile as well.~~
- **Make it compatible with Firefox as well**
- *Maybe add automatic update? (like Password Manager)*
