# Simple Login Manager for Therap Sites


### TODO
- ~~remove hardcoded data~~
- update ui
- Edit the profiles
- Change Profile Order by Dragging
- remove the need for triple clicks: also doesnt work when already values are populated
- work perfectly for incognito (might need to store in `chrome.storage.local` as well)
- **Make it compatible with Firefox as well**
- *Maybe add automatic update? (like Password Manager)*
